# Discord-crap

**discord-bridge.py**
Originally made as a joke, but it can have some practical use cases. The script uses Discord APIs to monitor events (Discord messages) within specific Discord servers. When a message is received, the bot will use Discord Webhooks to send a copy of the message to a different channel, usually belonging to a different server. Essentially, all of the chat will be transferred, including the Discord avatars, pretty much producing identical messages. 

If someone is annoying, you can add them to ANNOYING_LIST. Any messages from people added to the list will have their messages tRanSlatEd tO sPoNgEbOb TalK.
